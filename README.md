# Shift React Components
## Purpose

This repo is all extracted components/objects from the shift-front-end.
It holds all the styles for components.
These have been extracted to allow clients to use our pre-built components/objects in other projects if needed.
If needed you can overwrite the styles but these have been made with the intention to be used out-of-the-box.
